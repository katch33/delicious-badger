        <h2>Day 18 - Thursday 19th May</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
          So I managed to break the image in the post below just now which is a bit odd. I didn't adjust any paths or
          anything so not sure what's going on there. Anyway for the moment I will forget about it and push ahead to say
          I
          have a few gifs from my updated Space Fighter SHMUP tutorial game. I've been having a huge amount of fun
          adding
          to
          what we built in the tutorial. I've used tables to create objects that get added into other tables. An example
          of
          what this could look like in Pico 8 is:
        <blockquote>
          function add_stars(num)<br>
          for s in all(stars) do<br>
          add(stars,s={<br>
          x=64,<br>
          y=64,<br>
          spd=1<br>
          })<br>
          end<br>
          end
        </blockquote>
        The code above is a function that takes one argument (in our case num for number of stars) and adds to our table
        (named stars) an entry which is itself a table listing info about the star such as it's x value, it's y value
        and
        it's speed. Further down in the games update function you can take the speed (spd) value away from the stars x
        location <blockquote>st.x-=st.s</st>
        </blockquote>
        This happens until the star disappears off the left hand side of the screen. At this point we reset it's
        location
        to
        the far right side of the screen and it moves past the screen once more. I took this a few steps on and created
        the
        following function:<br>
        <blockquote>function add_stars(dist,distbrite,dst,body,star)</blockquote><br>
        This lovely function takes 5 arguments. Each one generates the equivalent number of that background layer. The
        first
        argument, DIST controls the furthest slow moving distant dark stars. A setting over 100 works surprisingly well.
        In
        fact in the first gif under this post I have DIST set to 500. So far I don't see any performance impact turning
        that
        up to 10,000. At about 14,000 background stars Pico 8 starts to ru out of memory almost immediately so 500 seems
        reasonable for now.<br><br>
        After that there are a handful of other layers. DISTBRITE is a small layer of 20 stars right now. It generates
        bright single pixel objects meant to represent planets/stations etc. DST is for dust which is what I've called
        the
        dark circles of varying sizes that come in blue and dim red. THe next layer is a wider spread of larger circles.
        These have 3 colors which don't overlap the previous layer. Finally there are the nearest stars. THhe ones that
        have
        the different coloured long tails. There are 25 of these to give the scene a lot of animation. I want to add a
        slight wobble to the ship to give it the impression of hovering in space, rather than being fixed still when the
        player isn't providing input. I'll talk about specifics a bit more in another post someday, but for now I'm
        going
        to
        remind myself that tomorrow the new website should be up and running. And that is all.
