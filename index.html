	  <p>I created and maintain this website as a journal and interactive example to myself of my improvements in coding. As my skills improve so too will this webpage. Below you will find my links as well as a resources section. I want to make games for a living and be my own boss. Here goes.

    <p><em>Below is my daily journal. The first two days were posted to a wordpress blog in markdown so I just copied them as text and dumped them in here so they look terrible and have a lovely border keeping them quarantined.</em></p>
	  
	 <h2> Day 5 - Friday 6th May</h2>
    <p>
		I've done it! I learned how to code. I became a professional game designer. Well done everyone. I couldn't have done it without all the support and encouragement I received. Now to shut down the site and live remotely while traveling in a van and posting about it on <a href="https://pixelfed.org/" target="_blank">Pixelfed.</a>
		<br>
	    	<br>
		I jest of course. I'm still only a semi-pro ( -_-)
		<br>
		What I actually learnt how to make today was a responsive and stylish info card in CSS and HTML. I followed a lesson by Kevin Powell on his excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/kepowob" target="_blank">youtube</a> channel and it felt vvery satisfying to complete. There is a <a href="https://github.com/katch33/oblong-barista" target="_blank">repo</a> now that works with the basic card which is pretty cool. I'm going to add some more elements to it day by day as I progress. Once I have them fucntioning properly I will start <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajazzle" target="_blank">vajazzling</a> up my site. Speaking of which...
		<br>
		I also began work on a fancier looking website for myself. 5 minutes of pro tips and I felt I could build anything. I have a concept in my head already and it's slowly taking shape. Very very slowly. On the gaming front I spent a few minutes today cleaning up some of my pico8 code and formatiing but mostly the last couple of days have been web stuff. Tomorrow will be taken up with a family event so I'm not sure where I will fit in some screen time but I'm sure I can write a rough draft of the day on my phone, and if I find a quiet room maybe I can bring a bluetooth keyboard for my phone...
		<br>
		<br>
		Usually I work at my desk. I have a rather compact desk that barely has space for the ludicrous monitor setup I use. I am fortunate enought to have been gifted a monitor by a friend that was leaving the country, so at present I am using a 34"
		<br>
		Finally my soundtrack for the day was mostly Devin Townsend solo albums and some Prince. Philoso-rock and Funk'n'Roll are great music to keep my head focused. Lunch today was diced chestnut mushrooms sauteed in butter and mezze cheese served on toasted sourdough and for dinner we got our weekly takeaway from Wallace Taverna. I had one glass of whiskey and multiple coffees, waters etc. It's 23:51 so I think I need to go to sleep now.
    </p>
	  
    <h2> Day 4 - Thursday 5th May</h2>
    <p>
      I don't think I have the passion for the practice yet. I definitely have the desire. I've got the capability but I don't feel like I wake up filled with the burning passion to be a game designer.
      <br>
      Case in point. I'm more excited about this webpage that my game design efforts. I think that's only because I can see more immediate results with this website. I can sit down and clack away <a href ="https://duckduckgo.com/">ducking</a> up "how to make a linear gradient in css" and "center contents of div responsively" and BOOM! My website has evolved, my showing off is flashier, I must be getting better right?
      <br>
      <br>
      With games it's very different. Or it seems to be so far. You have an idea, a concept. I want to make a Breakout style game! Perfect. Nice and simple. All I need is a ball. And a paddle. And some bricks. And some physics. And some controls. And a score/level system. And maybe something to handle special effects. And maybe some sound design...
      <br>(And maybe)<sup>n</sup>
      </p>

    <h2> Day 3 - Wednesday 4th May</h2>
      <p>I spent the majority of today working through the start of the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Free Code Camp</a> course in HTML5 and CSS. I decided that if I was going to have my own website I may as well learn how to make it as well as possible. It's been a long time since I've done any website coding and I'm finding it refreshing. I was tempted not to write anything and say that the website would stand for itself as my journal but that's nonsense. An excuse not to stick to my commitment to become my own boss and make videogames for a living. While it may seem that frontend website design isn't a step on the path to being a game developer I think it's important to keep my mind flexible and learning the same concepts across different systems and languages. After all a lot of the articles I have read seem to say that the language you use is not itself so important, but rather the concepts you apply. We'll see if that's true.
      <br>
      My favourite thing about today was figuring out how to use git from the command line in gitpod again. Setting that environment up and succesfully doing something felt great. TO go from my older markdown page to this (admittedly hideous) self made site feels good. Tomorrow I will be very late getting my daily practice done and writing my journal entry but I will still do it.
      <br>
      <br>
      Today I listened to a lot of Offspring, Devin Townsend and <a href="https://coderadio.freecodecamp.org/" target="blank">Free Code Camp Radio</a> with a background of waves and birds courtesy of <a href="https://asoftmurmur.com/" target="blank">A soft Murmur</a>

    <p>Everything below this point is from my wordpress markdown site and not formatted, it is simply dumped as a copy/paste. I will format it at a later stage. For now the old site is still viewable as the README.md file in the repository for this website.</p>

      <h2>Day 2 - Tuesday May 3rd 2022</h2>
        <p>## I Want To Make Videogames Day 2 - Tuesday May 3rd 2022
        > When I first got serious about trying to write a game I considered trying to translate an existing tabeltop game to a simple rpg. I thought the concrete rules and straightforward random dice rolls would make it easier to work on but there were so many challenges and I hadn't anticipated. I quickly realised that there were concepts and techniques used for the most basic things that I had no idea how to implement. Even a simple game has a lot of moving parts.  
        > Loops have always frustrated me. I'm not sure why. I understand the logic, the layout, the order I'm supposed to type my code but for some reason when it comes time to build my own solution and use a loop for something meaningful it's like they get prickly, or messy. I'm using them a lot in the [Porklike](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLea8cjCua_P3LL7J1Q9b6PJua0A-96uUS) tutorial so I think that will make them stick.  
        > Writing my starship sreensaver game thing helped a lot too. I had to iterate through all the positions and update everything, obviously loops were a big help in doing that. I have a lot of fun trying to animate little pixel art scenes and environments, loops will certainly make effects like rain easier.  
        > I've added a link to the educational version of pico 8 above. It is the complete software running in a browser window, and it currently requires a phyiscal hard drive. If you use the save command you can download your work so it's great for trying out the software or coding on the go! </p>
      <h2>Day 1 - <time></time></h2>
        <p>## I Want To Make Videogames Day 1 - Monday May 2nd 2022
        > It was Command and Conquer Red Alert that cemented part of my personal identity as that of gamer. I remember selecting the big boxed version of it from the shelf. It came bundled with a red Soviet mouse. It was the coolest thing I’d ever seen. I wonder how many gamers try to make games? I’m sure we all think about doing it. Currently I am 12 episodes into the wonderful [Porklike](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLea8cjCua_P3LL7J1Q9b6PJua0A-96uUS) tutorial series by Lazy Devs Academy and the wonderful @krystman @ [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social) I intend to post once a day and update on my progress until I’ve released a finished game. Who knows what will happen after that.  
        > The tool I’ve had the most fun using has been pico 8. It contains everything you need to make a complete self contained little game. The first thing I ever wrote in it that worked was an ultra simple tamagotchi. If you’re interested in game development it’s definitely worth using it and running through some tutorials to get a feel for how putting a game together works. I’m also trying to learn the Godot engine but working through it at a much slower pace. I backed a kickstarter for a complete game dev course using Godot so I am following that, but for now the focus will be these pico 8 tutorials until I complete them.  
        > That will about do it for today I think. Tomorrow I will write a bit more about what I know and what I think I’m in the middle of learning. To anyone out there struggling to make games, do it daily. Stick with it and give it a bit of time each day. Follow structured tutorials and even if you don’t understand everything keep moving forward with it. The more you complete the more you are learning, and the more things you break the better you get at learning.  
        > I hope.</p>
