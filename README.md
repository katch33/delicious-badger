# katch33 / Martin  

This website is a static journal page for me to track my game design work.  
I have written the site in markdown and hosted it on my github to provide  
a simple clean way of having everything centralised.

Below you will find links to my itch.io page, my youtube channel and a link  
to join Mastodon, a de-centralised micro-blogging platform spread over many  
servers/instances.

# journal - most recent always at the top
I will update this once a day, posts will be of varying length and on different topics. I will try to provide regular updates for projects I mention.

## I Want To Make Videogames Day 2 - Tuesday May 3rd 2022
> When I first got serious about trying to write a game I considered trying to translate an existing tabeltop game to a simple rpg. I thought the concrete rules and straightforward random dice rolls would make it easier to work on but there were so many challenges and I hadn't anticipated. I quickly realised that there were concepts and techniques used for the most basic things that I had no idea how to implement. Even a simple game has a lot of moving parts.  
> Loops have always frustrated me. I'm not sure why. I understand the logic, the layout, the order I'm supposed to type my code but for some reason when it comes time to build my own solution and use a loop for something meaningful it's like they get prickly, or messy. I'm using them a lot in the [Porklike](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLea8cjCua_P3LL7J1Q9b6PJua0A-96uUS) tutorial so I think that will make them stick.  
> Writing my starship sreensaver game thing helped a lot too. I had to iterate through all the positions and update everything, obviously loops were a big help in doing that. I have a lot of fun trying to animate little pixel art scenes and environments, loops will certainly make effects like rain easier.  
> I've added a link to the educational version of pico 8 above. It is the complete software running in a browser window, and it currently requires a phyiscal hard drive. If you use the save command you can download your work so it's great for trying out the software or coding on the go!

## I Want To Make Videogames Day 1 - Monday May 2nd 2022
> It was Command and Conquer Red Alert that cemented part of my personal identity as that of gamer. I remember selecting the big boxed version of it from the shelf. It came bundled with a red Soviet mouse. It was the coolest thing I’d ever seen. I wonder how many gamers try to make games? I’m sure we all think about doing it. Currently I am 12 episodes into the wonderful [Porklike](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLea8cjCua_P3LL7J1Q9b6PJua0A-96uUS) tutorial series by Lazy Devs Academy and the wonderful @krystman @ [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social) I intend to post once a day and update on my progress until I’ve released a finished game. Who knows what will happen after that.  
> The tool I’ve had the most fun using has been pico 8. It contains everything you need to make a complete self contained little game. The first thing I ever wrote in it that worked was an ultra simple tamagotchi. If you’re interested in game development it’s definitely worth using it and running through some tutorials to get a feel for how putting a game together works. I’m also trying to learn the Godot engine but working through it at a much slower pace. I backed a kickstarter for a complete game dev course using Godot so I am following that, but for now the focus will be these pico 8 tutorials until I complete them.  
> That will about do it for today I think. Tomorrow I will write a bit more about what I know and what I think I’m in the middle of learning. To anyone out there struggling to make games, do it daily. Stick with it and give it a bit of time each day. Follow structured tutorials and even if you don’t understand everything keep moving forward with it. The more you complete the more you are learning, and the more things you break the better you get at learning.  
> I hope.
